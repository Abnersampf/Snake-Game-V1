# Snake-Game-V1
My first attempt to make a snake game, I didn't use any references, I did everything based on my logic.

ABOUT THE GAME:
- Self-collision mechanism included;
- Game over and win mechanism included;
- Edge collision mechanism included;
- Game restart mechanism included;
- Points counter included;

IMPORTANT:
- This game is extremely slow, regardless of whether you change the speed (in the "speed" variable) it will still be slow (unless you have a good computer). This is due to the fact that there are many comparisons and calculations that are made with each screen update, and another thing is that with each update the program erases and redraws the game.
- Use .NET 7.0;
- I don't recommend running this code in online compilers, as they are extremely slow (compile on your machine);
- I recommend using Visual Studio;
- Don't run this program in your IDE's terminal (unless you're using Visual Studio, because it already opens the .exe file directly), look for the .exe file that was generated (after compiling) and run it.
